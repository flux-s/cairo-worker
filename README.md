# cairo-worker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flux-s/cairo-worker.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flux-s/cairo-worker)

*A docker image containing a very simple REST service for document rendering using cairo + node-canvas + vega.*

This is mostly intended as a worker for [flux-templating](https://github.com/flux-s/flux-templating) but can be used independently.
